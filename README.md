This is a project for the Web Design course given at the Amsterdam University of Applies Sciences!
This project is all about A11Y (accessibility). And for this project I will be designing a web tool for just one person!

## The Challenge
My client has a big problem. The client competes in a lanecycling division of the highest order. The client gets a full schedule each year made in Microsoft Office Excel!
The schedule works by color notations and ofcourse cells filled in with strings. Problem? My client lost sight several years ago.
So my client uses a Braille keyboard tool attached to here Macintosh or iPad. The client uses JAWS on the laptop for screenreading. And Voice Over by Apple on the Apple iPhone.


I am going to create a tool where my client can navigate and find stuff in the spreadsheet without too much effort.
By designing a tool that follows the W3C standards, being semantically correct and scoring high on A11Y. The tool will be designed to be used with an screenreader and user input.
My client told me that the client prefers text as an input as talking to a device is something to be considered awkward in the Netherlands.

## Getting Started
The application can be found at this location: https://robert-hoekstra.github.io/web-design-1920/

### Quick-Start
This webpage is specially designed to the user requirements of my client. It is a design for 1 person only.

The page can be used by any other person however the page is optimized for keyboard navigation and screenreader tools.

Therefore, navigating with tab, arrows, space & enter are mandatory to get the full experience like my client does.

## Installation
Do you want to run the application on your local machine?

* 1. Clone the repo

` git clone https://github.com/robert-hoekstra/web-design-1920.git`

* 2. Navigate to folder

* 3. Open index.html in your browser or start a localhost and open index.html

## Documentation
